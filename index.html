<p>The app uses storage permissions, which allows the app to extend its functionality once the user has allowed the app to access storage. There are two tasks regarding storage permission in this app. One is to select an image from the gallery, and the other one is to save a PDF version of your vocabularies in the storage.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a><li>
